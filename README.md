Augmented reality role playing

This is intended to be a new AR app, based on a pervious app (Self Help Desk). Currently, it requires some 3rd party assets from the Unity store:
* DOTween
* Toony Tiny People
* Raw Wooden Furniture (free)
* Quirky Series Forest Owl
* iOS Haptic Feedback
* And the SF-Pro-Display font (Apple). 

To install and run, you'll probably need these assets installed within Unity.

Goals:
* Create a new app that uses some of the same ideas as the Self Help Desk
* Reduce the reliance on 3rd party closed source assets
