Augmented reality role playing

This is intended to be a new AR app, based on a pervious app (Self Help Desk). Currently, it requires some 3rd party assets from the Unity store:
* DOTween
* Toony Tiny People
* Raw Wooden Furniture (free)
* Resonance Audio
* Quirky Series Forest Owl
* iOS Haptic Feedback
* And the SF-Pro-Display font (Apple). 

To install and run, you'll probably need these assets installed within Unity. Please feel free to contact me if any issues getting this running, as I'd love to have collaborators.

Goals:
* Create a new app that uses some of the same ideas as the Self Help Desk
* Reduce the reliance on 3rd party closed source assets
* For me to gain experience coding other people
* To learn how to code better
